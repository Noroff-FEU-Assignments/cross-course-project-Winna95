    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[To secure a website from web security attacks I would advise my potential client to use strong passwords and effective password management. Besides a strong password, they should use two-factor authentication, where you must enter an authentication code sent to your phone. I would also recommend my client to use HTTPS. HTTPS makes sure that your login credentials, cookies, and other valuable information are difficult for the attacker to reach. Next, I will advise my client to keep an eye on the threats out there, and then start to address the vulnerabilities that are most common first. You should use tools for vulnerability scanning so that your site gets automated security tested. Finally, I will recommend to my client that they should just store and display the data they need. If they need to store sensitive information, for example credit card information, they should just display what is necessary for the user to be identified. If you display too much, the attacker can copy it and use it on other sites. It is most common to show the last 4 digits of the number on the credit card.]</p>
